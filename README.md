# Commune
----------

As the world gets worse, one of the only ways to enjoy life is through _*escapism*_! (NOT INSTEAD OF DIRECT ACTION) \
This modpack was designed around a communal approach to multiplayer servers. \
Join your friends and escape in building a model tomorrow, out of blocks!

### Features

- Performance/Optimization mods
- Tech/Automation
- Quality of Life improvements
- Fantasy/Fun!
- _*Detailed list of mods and their purpose can be found in the [GitHub repository][gh-modlist-url]. (On Modrinth, click "view source")*_

## Credits
----------
This project is in no way possible without the fabulous mod creators and their contributors.


## Installation
----------
****For players:**** \
Use your favorite modpack launcher to install the modpack. I've tested PrismLauncher and the Modrinth app. PrismLauncher has the ability to prompt the user to select optional mods to be downloaded. The Modrinth app will download those optional mods regardless; after which, they can be disabled in the "Content" section of the Modrinth app.
Players can also use the 'Lite' profile of the modpack on older/less powerful computers. Lite versions are denoted by a 'l' suffixed to the version number.

****For server admins:**** \
Use a tool such as [`mrpack-install`][mrpack-install-url] or [`docker-compose`][docker-compose-url] to automatically download a preconfigured server environment. The aforementioned tools will only install mods that run on the server. Client exclusive mods will be skipped.
